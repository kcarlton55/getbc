    <h1 id="top">Virtual environments</h1>
	
	<p>If you intend to use only getbc.py to install and/or upgrade bomcheck (and bomcheckgui), you do not 
	need to know anything about what this article has to say.&nbsp;  But if you wish to have a bit more
	control of Python's handling of bomcheck, read on.</p>
	
	<h2>What is a virtual environment?</h2>
	
	<p>The computer language Python often uses what's called virtual envirnments to isolate code packages 
	in order to keep the code organized and managed.&nbsp; If you used getbc.py to install bomcheck, a virtual environment
    (VE) was automatically created for you.&nbsp; Bomcheck, bomcheckgui, and their dependent code were put
	into that virtual enviornment.&nbsp; Only the VE that getbc produced will be discussed in this article.  Other 
	means of creating VEs are outside the scope of this article.</p>

    <p>Getbc.py produces a virtual environment called bc-venv.&nbsp;  It is essentially just a directory named bc-venv.
    It contains the bomcheck code plus it contains some additional code that can activate the virtual 
    environment.&nbsp;  When activated, only the code from within that environment is available to execute. 
	&nbsp;Bc-venv could have been placed anywhere on the drive of your computer, but getbc.py was designed to 
	put bc-venv in your user folder.</p>	
	
	<h2>Activating the bc-venv virtual environment</h2>
	
	<p>Bc-venv contains a subdirectory named Scripts.&nbsp; In the Scripts subdirectory is a file that can
	be executed from a command line interface (CLI) named activate.bat.&nbsp;  For example, for the user Ken
	this will activate the virtual environment (path will vary on your computer):</p>
	
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><code>C:\Users\Ken\bc-venv\Sripts\activate</code></li></ul>
	
	<p>It is recomended to copy this command to a text file for easy access at a later date.&nbsp;  With the virtual 
	environment activated, the command prompt will change to look something like:
	
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;"><li><code>(bc-venv) C:\Users\Ken> </code></li></ul>
	
	<p>Note: By executing <i>py getbc.py --copy</i> you can see the proper command to use for your computer.</p>

    <h2>What can you do with an activated environment?</h2> 

    <ol>
      <li>To install bomcheck from the command line do:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>py -m pip install bomcheck</code></li>
	  <li>To upgrade bomcheck from the command line do:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>py -m pip install --upgrade bomcheck</code></li>
	  <li>To install bomcheckgui from the command line do:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>py -m pip install bomcheckgui</code></li>
	  <li>To upgrade bomcheckgui from the command line do:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>py -m pip install --upgrade bomcheckgui</code></li>
      <li>run bomcheck from the command line:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>bomcheck</code></li>
      <li>run bomcheckgui from the command line:&nbsp;&nbsp; <code>bomcheckgui</code></li>
    </ol>
