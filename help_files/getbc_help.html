    <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>getbc is program meant to allow a user to quickly and easily install 
      bomchecgui.  Normally to be somewhat proficient with the python
      programming language requires taking a taking a class to learn even
      the basics.  Python programmers typically type commands into a command line
      interface (cli) instead of a graphical user interface (gui). This can
      be confusing to most people.  The getbc program eliminates most this
      hassle and tries to make installing bomcheckgui as easy as possible.</p>
    
    <p>This help file is broken down into two sections.  The first provides just the 
      barest explation about getting bomcheckgui up and running. The second section
      gives a longer explanation about the various commands used to install bomcheckgui. 
      It's not necessary to read this section.  But if you're curious to understand
      some details about using python, this is a good read.</p>
      
    <h2 id="section1">Quick explanation about how to install</h2>
    
    <p> On your computer open the Atlas Copco software center app.  Do this
      by going to the window's start menu and typing in "software center". 
      Open that app that's found and search for "Python 3.8.9".  Download and install 
      that app.</p>
      
    <p> Next go to this web address: https://github.com/kcarlton55/getbc/tree/master/src.
      From there download "getbc.py". 
      Do this by right cliking on the file and selecting the menu item named 
      "copy link address".  Store getbc.py at any convenient location on your computer.</p>
    
    <p> Using Window's file explorer go to the directory where you stored getbc.py.
      In the address bar type: cmd.  A cli window will pop up.  Type in "dir"
      and you will see any files in that directory including getbc.py.
      
    <p> In the cli window, have python run the getbc.py script file by typing in:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px"> py getbc.py</p>
    
    <p> You should now see some instructions telling you how to install bomcheckgui
      on your computer.</p>

    <h2 id="basics">Basics you need to know</h2>
    <p>The file names for BOMs that come from the CAD program should be
      the part no. of the BOM followed by _sw.xlsx. That is, names like
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx,&nbsp; 093352_sw.xlsx,&nbsp; and 35K2445_sw.xlsx&nbsp; are all
      legitimate file names.&nbsp; Similarly the names of the files from the ERP database should end
      with _sl.xlsx. Thus the names will look like 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx,&nbsp;
      093352_sl.xlsx,&nbsp; and 35K2445_sl.xlsx. The program will match the
      0300-2010-005_sw.xlsx file to the 0300-2010-005_sl.xlsx file, and so forth.</p>
